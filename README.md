This project presents a bubble chart visualization analyzing the relationship between app size and average rating using Google Play Store data. The chart includes filters to show only high-quality apps (rating > 3.5, reviews > 500, sentiment subjectivity > 0.5, etc.) across selected categories like Game, Beauty, Business, Dating, and others. The size of each bubble represents the number of installs, with category names translated into Hindi, Tamil, and German where applicable. The chart is designed to be visible only between 5 PM and 7 PM IST, simulating a time-restricted dashboard view.
